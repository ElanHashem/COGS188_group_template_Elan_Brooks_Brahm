    "# Abstract \n",
    "Our project explores AI-driven algorithmic trading strategies to optimize portfolio performance by predicting market trends and making informed trading decisions. We use historical stock data, including price movements, trading volume, and technical indicators, to develop predictive models. Our approach incorporates Neural Networks (NN), Temporal Difference (TD) Learning, and Dynamic Programming (DP) to forecast price changes and execute optimal trades. We evaluate model performance using financial metrics such as the Sharpe Ratio, total return, and average prediction error, comparing AI-driven strategies against the traditional Buy and Hold (BH) approach. Our results show that while BH outperforms most rule-based strategies in stable conditions, optimized AI models can generate higher portfolio returns when hyperparameters like train/test split and trade thresholds are tuned effectively. This study highlights the potential of AI in financial markets while acknowledging the important challenges of market volatility and overfitting."

    "# Background\n",
    "\n",
    "Algorithmic trading has revolutionized financial markets by enabling high-speed, data-driven decision-making that surpasses human capabilities[1][2]. The integration of machine learning (ML) and reinforcement learning (RL) has further enhanced these systems, allowing for adaptive strategies that respond to dynamic market conditions[3][4]. This project builds on foundational work in quantitative finance, where ML models such as neural networks and ensemble methods have demonstrated empirical success in predicting price movements and optimizing trade execution[3][5]. For instance, neural networks have been shown to identify non-linear patterns in historical data that traditional statistical methods often miss[3][6], while ensemble techniques like gradient-boosted decision trees improve robustness against market noise[5][6]. Reinforcement learning has emerged as a particularly promising paradigm for algorithmic trading due to its ability to optimize decision-making processes through trial-and-error interactions with market environments[4][7]. Unlike supervised learning, which relies on static datasets, RL agents learn policies that maximize cumulative rewards—a framework naturally aligned with trading’s sequential decision-making requirements[4]. Recent studies, such as those by Pricope (2021), highlight DRL’s capacity to handle high-dimensional state spaces, including order book dynamics and macroeconomic indicators[4]. Empirical results from cryptocurrency markets demonstrate that RL-based strategies can achieve 31.53% returns under volatile conditions, outperforming traditional rule-based systems by 22 percentage points[7]. These advancements underscore RL’s potential to adapt strategies in real time while managing transaction costs and market impact[7][8].\n",
    "\n",
    "This project advances prior work by rigorously evaluating model performance across varying market conditions—a gap identified in recent literature reviews[1]. By testing strategies on equities, cryptocurrencies, and commodities, the analysis addresses concerns about strategy robustness raised by Gerner-Beuerle (2021), who documented algorithmic trading’s role in amplifying volatility during the 2010 Flash Crash[1]. Furthermore, the incorporation of dynamic programming principles enables real-time portfolio rebalancing, optimizing position sizing while adhering to risk constraints[9]. Through comprehensive backtesting against metrics like the Sharpe ratio and maximum drawdown[7][5], the project provides a framework for developing AI-driven trading systems that balance profitability with stability in evolving financial ecosystems.\n",
    "\n",
    "This synthesis of RL adaptability, feature engineering, and cross-market validation positions the project to contribute meaningfully to the $1.5 trillion algorithmic trading industry, where even marginal improvements in strategy efficiency yield substantial economic impacts[1][2]."

    "# Problem Statement\n",
    "\n",
    "Financial markets are inherently volatile, making it challenging to develop trading strategies that consistently outperform traditional approaches while managing risk. Initially, our goal was to maximize trading opportunities, but our focus developed towards predicting market trends and making informed trading decisions based on those predictions. This project integrates machine learning techniques, including Temporal Difference (TD) learning, Dynamic Programming (DP), and Neural Networks (NN), to optimize portfolio performance. By leveraging historical market data, we train models to predict price movements and identify optimal buy/sell points through backtracking and reinforcement learning principles. The effectiveness of our strategies is measured using key financial metrics such as the Sharpe ratio, total return, and prediction error. We benchmark our models against the Buy and Hold strategy to evaluate performance across different time periods and market conditions. Through hyperparameter tuning and company-wide analysis, we refine our models to maximize profitability while mitigating risk, ensuring adaptability in dynamic financial environments."

    "#### **3. Data Transformation**\n",
    "- Converted timestamps to `datetime` format for easier time-series processing.\n",
    "- Sorted data by `Company` and `Date` to maintain chronological integrity.\n",

    "# Proposed Solution\n",
    " \n",
    "Our approach optimizes algorithmic trading strategies by integrating reinforcement learning (TD Learning) and Dynamic Programming (DP) to make data-driven trading decisions. Instead of relying solely on rule-based or traditional statistical models, we use machine learning techniques to predict market movements and execute optimal buy/sell strategies.  \n",
    "\n",
    "##### **Problem Formulation: Trading as a Sequential Decision Process**\n",
    "We model the trading problem using Temporal Difference Learning and Dynamic Programming to determine the best buy, sell, or hold decisions based on historical stock data. Our goal is to maximize portfolio returns by learning from past market movements and optimizing trade execution.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### **1. State (S): Market Representation**\n",
    "Each state represents the market at a given time and includes:  \n",
    "- **OHLCV Data**: Open, High, Low, Close, Volume.  \n",
    "- **Technical Indicators**: Moving Averages (SMA, EMA), Volatility, Relative Strength Index (RSI), MACD.  \n",
    "- **Market Trends**: Rolling price changes, trend momentum.  \n",
    "- **Portfolio Status**: Current holdings, cash balance, previous transactions.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### **2. Actions (A): Trading Decisions**\n",
    "At each time step, the algorithm decides between:  \n",
    "- **Buy**: Purchase stock at the current price.  \n",
    "- **Sell**: Sell stock at the current price.  \n",
    "- **Hold**: Maintain the current position.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### **3. Reward Function (R): Incentivizing Profitability**\n",
    "- **Profit Maximization**: The reward function is defined as:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\[\n",
    "R_t = P_{t+1} - P_t\n",

    "\n",
    "- **Transaction Costs**: Penalize excessive trading to minimize fees.  \n",
    "- **Holding Time Penalty**: Discourage holding onto a losing position for too long.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### **4. Dynamic Programming (DP) for Trade Optimization**\n",
    "Once TD Learning generates price predictions, Dynamic Programming (DP) is used to backtrack from the final date to identify optimal buy/sell points. By systematically evaluating potential trading decisions over time, DP finds the most profitable trades across the entire prediction window, outperforming naïve strategies.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Implementation Steps**\n",
    "1. **Data Preprocessing**: Clean and engineer features from Yahoo Finance data.  \n",
    "2. **TD Learning Prediction**: Train a reinforcement learning model on historical prices.  \n",
