    "# Abstract \n",
    "Our project explores AI-driven algorithmic trading strategies to optimize portfolio performance by predicting market trends and making informed trading decisions. We use historical stock data, including price movements, trading volume, and technical indicators, to develop predictive models. Our approach incorporates Neural Networks (NN), Temporal Difference (TD) Learning, and Dynamic Programming (DP) to forecast price changes and execute optimal trades. We evaluate model performance using financial metrics such as the Sharpe Ratio, total return, and average prediction error, comparing AI-driven strategies against the traditional Buy and Hold (BH) approach. Our results show that while BH outperforms most rule-based strategies in stable conditions, optimized AI models can generate higher portfolio returns when hyperparameters like train/test split and trade thresholds are tuned effectively. This study highlights the potential of AI in financial markets while acknowledging the important challenges of market volatility and overfitting."

    "# Problem Statement\n",
    "\n",
    "Financial markets are inherently volatile, making it challenging to develop trading strategies that consistently outperform traditional approaches while managing risk. Initially, our goal was to maximize trading opportunities, but our focus developed towards predicting market trends and making informed trading decisions based on those predictions. This project integrates machine learning techniques, including Temporal Difference (TD) learning, Dynamic Programming (DP), and Neural Networks (NN), to optimize portfolio performance. By leveraging historical market data, we train models to predict price movements and identify optimal buy/sell points through backtracking and reinforcement learning principles. The effectiveness of our strategies is measured using key financial metrics such as the Sharpe ratio, total return, and prediction error. We benchmark our models against the Buy and Hold strategy to evaluate performance across different time periods and market conditions. Through hyperparameter tuning and company-wide analysis, we refine our models to maximize profitability while mitigating risk, ensuring adaptability in dynamic financial environments."

    "\n",
    "### **Source and Structure**\n",
    "Our dataset was obtained from Yahoo Finance via the [Massive Yahoo Finance Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/iveeaten3223times/massive-yahoo-finance-dataset) on Kaggle. It includes historical stock data for multiple companies, spanning several years, with daily and minute-level price observations.\n",
    "\n",
    "Each row in the dataset represents a timestamped stock price entry, typically structured as follows:\n",
    "- **Company**: Stock ticker symbol (e.g., AAPL, TSLA).\n",
    "- **Date**: Timestamp for the recorded data.\n",
    "- **Open, High, Low, Close Prices (OHLC)**: Standard stock price metrics.\n",
    "- **Adjusted Close**: Adjusted for stock splits and dividends.\n",
    "- **Volume**: The number of shares traded.\n",
    "\n",
    "After cleaning and preprocessing, our final dataset contained over **600,000 observations**, with essential financial metrics used for strategy evaluation.\n",

    "### **Data Cleaning and Preprocessing**\n",
    "To ensure high-quality inputs for our models, we applied the following preprocessing steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **1. Handling Missing Data**\n",
    "- Dropped rows with missing OHLC prices to maintain data integrity.\n",
    "- Forward-filled missing values due to market closures on weekends and holidays.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **2. Feature Engineering**\n",
    "To enhance model performance, we generated additional features:\n",
    "- Returns Calculation: Daily percentage change in stock price:\n",
    "  ```python\n",
    "  \n",
    "  df[\"Return\"] = df.groupby(\"Company\")[\"Close\"].pct_change()\n",

    "- **Price Indicators**:\n",
    "  - Prev_Close: Closing price of the previous day.\n",
    "  - Price Change**: Difference between current and previous close price.\n",
    "  - Volatility: 5-day rolling standard deviation of closing prices.\n",
    "- **Technical Indicators**:\n",
    "  - **Simple Moving Averages (SMA)**:\n",
    "    ```python\n",
    "    df[\"SMA_10\"] = df.groupby(\"Company\")[\"Close\"].transform(lambda x: x.rolling(window=10, min_periods=1).mean())\n",

    "#### **3. Data Transformation**\n",
    "- Converted timestamps to `datetime` format for easier time-series processing.\n",
    "- Sorted data by `Company` and `Date` to maintain chronological integrity.\n",

    "# Proposed Solution\n",
    " \n",
    "Our approach optimizes algorithmic trading strategies by integrating reinforcement learning (TD Learning) and Dynamic Programming (DP) to make data-driven trading decisions. Instead of relying solely on rule-based or traditional statistical models, we use machine learning techniques to predict market movements and execute optimal buy/sell strategies.  \n",
    "\n",
    "##### **Problem Formulation: Trading as a Sequential Decision Process**\n",
    "We model the trading problem using Temporal Difference Learning and Dynamic Programming to determine the best buy, sell, or hold decisions based on historical stock data. Our goal is to maximize portfolio returns by learning from past market movements and optimizing trade execution.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### **1. State (S): Market Representation**\n",
    "Each state represents the market at a given time and includes:  \n",
    "- **OHLCV Data**: Open, High, Low, Close, Volume.  \n",
    "- **Technical Indicators**: Moving Averages (SMA, EMA), Volatility, Relative Strength Index (RSI), MACD.  \n",
    "- **Market Trends**: Rolling price changes, trend momentum.  \n",
    "- **Portfolio Status**: Current holdings, cash balance, previous transactions.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### **2. Actions (A): Trading Decisions**\n",
    "At each time step, the algorithm decides between:  \n",
    "- **Buy**: Purchase stock at the current price.  \n",
    "- **Sell**: Sell stock at the current price.  \n",
    "- **Hold**: Maintain the current position.\n",
    "\n",

    "- **Profit Maximization**: The reward function is defined as:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\[\n",
    "R_t = P_{t+1} - P_t\n",
    "\\]\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Transaction Costs**: Penalize excessive trading to minimize fees.  \n",
    "- **Holding Time Penalty**: Discourage holding onto a losing position for too long.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### **4. Dynamic Programming (DP) for Trade Optimization**\n",
    "Once TD Learning generates price predictions, Dynamic Programming (DP) is used to backtrack from the final date to identify optimal buy/sell points. By systematically evaluating potential trading decisions over time, DP finds the most profitable trades across the entire prediction window, outperforming na√Øve strategies.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Implementation Steps**\n",
    "1. **Data Preprocessing**: Clean and engineer features from Yahoo Finance data.  \n",
    "2. **TD Learning Prediction**: Train a reinforcement learning model on historical prices.  \n",
    "3. **DP Optimization**: Apply Dynamic Programming to maximize profit using predicted prices.  \n",
    "4. **Strategy Backtesting**: Compare TD+DP Trading Strategy against the Buy-and-Hold Benchmark using real stock market data.  \n",
    "5. **Performance Evaluation**: Measure effectiveness using Sharpe Ratio, Total Return, and Drawdowns.\n",

    "**1. Sharpe Ratio**\n",

    "- If the short-term SMA drops below the long-term SMA, it generates a sell signal (bearish crossover).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why We Thought SMA Would Work Well**\n",
    "\n",
    "- Clear Trend Identification: By smoothing out noise, SMA should help identify when to buy and sell.\n",
    "- Widely Used: Many traders use SMA crossovers, so we expected it to have strong predictive power.\n",
    "- Historical Support: In certain markets, SMA strategies have shown profitability in past studies.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, despite our expectations, SMA underperformed significantly compared to Buy-and-Hold.\n",
    "\n",
    "After implementing the SMA strategy and computing its Sharpe Ratio, we observed a negative Sharpe Ratio (-0.4684), indicating poor risk-adjusted returns.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Reasons for SMA's Poor Performance**\n",
    "\n",
    "**1. Delayed Reactions:**\n",
    "- SMA is a lagging indicator, meaning it reacts slowly to price changes.\n",
    "- This resulted in late buy/sell decisions, causing us to miss good entry/exit points.\n",
    "\n",
    "**2. Frequent False Signals:**\n",
    "- The market does not always follow clean trends, leading to whipsaws (false signals causing unnecessary trades).\n",
    "- Increased trading meant higher transaction costs, further hurting performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "**3. Market Trends Are Often Sustained:**\n",
    "- The stock market generally follows long-term upward trends.\n",
    "- SMA often forced unnecessary exits when the price briefly dipped, whereas Buy-and-Hold stayed invested and benefited from long-term gains.\n",
    "\n",
    "After SMA failed, we tested Exponential Moving Average (EMA) and Moving Average Crossover with Momentum (MAC).\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "**Exponential Moving Average (EMA)**\n",
    "\n",
    "EMA is similar to SMA but gives more weight to recent prices, making it more responsive to trends.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why EMA Should Have Worked**\n",
    "\n",
    "- Faster Response to Trends: EMA adapts more quickly than SMA, potentially reducing lag.\n",
    "- More Dynamic Buy/Sell Signals: Could react quicker to price reversals.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why EMA Failed**\n",
    "\n",
    "Despite being more responsive, EMA still lagged behind sharp market movements.\n",
    "- Sharpe Ratio: -0.4612 ‚Üí slightly better than SMA but still negative.\n",
    "\n",
    "Still subject to false signals in volatile markets.\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "**Moving Average Crossover with Momentum (MAC)**\n",
    "\n",
    "MAC combines SMA crossovers with momentum analysis to confirm trends.\n",
    "‚Äã\n",
    " \n",
    "Momentum_t = P_t - P_t - n‚Äã\n",
    " \n",
    "where:\n",
    "\n",
    "- If momentum is positive, price is increasing.\n",
    "- If momentum is negative, price is decreasing.\n",
    "\n",
    "How It Works:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. If a short-term SMA crosses above a long-term SMA, check if momentum is positive.\n",
    "2. If yes ‚Üí BUY. If no ‚Üí ignore the signal.\n",
    "3. If a short-term SMA drops below a long-term SMA, check if momentum is negative.\n",
    "4. If yes ‚Üí SELL.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why MAC Should Have Worked**\n",
    "\n",
    "- It filters out false signals by confirming trends with momentum.\n",
    "- Could provide stronger buy/sell signals than SMA alone.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why MAC Failed**\n",
    "- Sharpe Ratio: -0.6221 ‚Üí even worse than SMA and EMA.\n",
    "- Too conservative, missing good trades by waiting for extra confirmation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Still not responsive enough to quick trend reversals.\n",
    "\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why did Buy-and-Hold Outperform?**\n",
    "- Lower trading costs (fewer transactions).  \n",
    "- Long-term growth captured without frequent exits.  \n",
    "- Less exposed to false signals from market fluctuations.  \n",

    "### 3. Case Study: Apple ‚Äì Comparing Temporal Difference Learning and Dynamic Programming Against Buy-and-Hold\n",
    "In this subsection, we analyze Apple Inc. (AAPL) to demonstrate our process of applying Temporal Difference Learning and Dynamic Programming as trading strategies, comparing their performance to the Buy-and-Hold strategy. The insights gained from this example will later help us generalize our findings to other stocks, such as Tesla (TSLA).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why We Chose AAPL for This Analysis**\n",
    "\n",
    "AAPL was selected as our primary example for several reasons:\n",
    "\n",
    "- High trading volume and liquidity ‚Üí Ensures a smoother price trend with fewer market anomalies.\n",
    "- Consistent long-term growth ‚Üí Helps evaluate how predictive strategies perform against a well-established uptrend.\n",
    "- Rich historical data ‚Üí Allows for more reliable backtesting of our models.\n",
    "\n",
    "To analyze AAPL, we applied TD Learning and DP on the stock price data and compared the resulting portfolio performance against Buy-and-Hold.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Implementing TD Learning for Price Prediction**\n",
    "\n",
    "Temporal Difference Learning is a reinforcement learning technique that updates value predictions incrementally based on observed rewards. Our TD agent learns to predict AAPL's closing prices and refines its predictions over time.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key Components of the TD Model**\n",
    "- `alpha` (learning rate): Determines how much the model updates its predictions based on new information.\n",
    "- `gamma` (discount factor): Balances immediate vs. future rewards.\n",
    "- State Representation: The previous closing price serves as the input state for the TD model.\n",
    "- Reward Function: The price difference between consecutive days serves as the reward.\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "OK, you've given us quite a bit of tech informaiton above, now its time to tell us what to pay attention to in all that.  Think clearly about your results, decide on one main point and 2-4 secondary points you want us to understand. Highlight HOW your results support those points.  You probably want 2-5 sentences per point.\n",

    "Are there any problems with the work?  For instance would more data change the nature of the problem? Would it be good to explore more hyperparams than you had time for?   \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Future work\n",
    "Looking at the limitations and/or the toughest parts of the problem and/or the situations where the algorithm(s) did the worst... is there something you'd like to try to make these better.\n",

    "### Ethics & Privacy\n",
    "\n",
    "If your project has obvious potential concerns with ethics or data privacy discuss that here.  Almost every ML project put into production can have ethical implications if you use your imagination. Use your imagination.\n",
    "\n",
    "Even if you can't come up with an obvious ethical concern that should be addressed, you should know that a large number of ML projects that go into producation have unintended consequences and ethical problems once in production. How will your team address these issues?\n",

    "### Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "Reiterate your main point and in just a few sentences tell us how your results support it. Mention how this work would fit in the background/context of other work in this field if you can. Suggest directions for future work if you want to."
