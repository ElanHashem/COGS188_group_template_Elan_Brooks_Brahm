    "# Abstract \n",
    "Our project explores AI-driven algorithmic trading strategies to optimize portfolio performance by predicting market trends and making informed trading decisions. We use historical stock data, including price movements, trading volume, and technical indicators, to develop predictive models. Our approach incorporates Neural Networks (NN), Temporal Difference (TD) Learning, and Dynamic Programming (DP) to forecast price changes and execute optimal trades. We evaluate model performance using financial metrics such as the Sharpe Ratio, total return, and average prediction error, comparing AI-driven strategies against the traditional Buy and Hold (BH) approach. Our results show that while BH outperforms most rule-based strategies in stable conditions, optimized AI models can generate higher portfolio returns when hyperparameters like train/test split and trade thresholds are tuned effectively. This study highlights the potential of AI in financial markets while acknowledging the important challenges of market volatility and overfitting."

    "# Problem Statement\n",
    "\n",
    "Financial markets are inherently volatile, making it challenging to develop trading strategies that consistently outperform traditional approaches while managing risk. Initially, our goal was to maximize trading opportunities, but our focus developed towards predicting market trends and making informed trading decisions based on those predictions. This project integrates machine learning techniques, including Temporal Difference (TD) learning, Dynamic Programming (DP), and Neural Networks (NN), to optimize portfolio performance. By leveraging historical market data, we train models to predict price movements and identify optimal buy/sell points through backtracking and reinforcement learning principles. The effectiveness of our strategies is measured using key financial metrics such as the Sharpe ratio, total return, and prediction error. We benchmark our models against the Buy and Hold strategy to evaluate performance across different time periods and market conditions. Through hyperparameter tuning and company-wide analysis, we refine our models to maximize profitability while mitigating risk, ensuring adaptability in dynamic financial environments."

    "# Data\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Source and Structure**\n",
    "Our dataset was obtained from Yahoo Finance via the [Massive Yahoo Finance Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/iveeaten3223times/massive-yahoo-finance-dataset) on Kaggle. It includes historical stock data for multiple companies, spanning several years, with daily and minute-level price observations.\n",
    "\n",
    "Each row in the dataset represents a timestamped stock price entry, typically structured as follows:\n",
    "- **Company**: Stock ticker symbol (e.g., AAPL, TSLA).\n",
    "- **Date**: Timestamp for the recorded data.\n",
    "- **Open, High, Low, Close Prices (OHLC)**: Standard stock price metrics.\n",
    "- **Adjusted Close**: Adjusted for stock splits and dividends.\n",
    "- **Volume**: The number of shares traded.\n",
    "\n",
    "After cleaning and preprocessing, our final dataset contained over **600,000 observations**, with essential financial metrics used for strategy evaluation.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Data Cleaning and Preprocessing**\n",
    "To ensure high-quality inputs for our models, we applied the following preprocessing steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **1. Handling Missing Data**\n",
    "- Dropped rows with missing OHLC prices to maintain data integrity.\n",
    "- Forward-filled missing values due to market closures on weekends and holidays.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **2. Feature Engineering**\n",
    "To enhance model performance, we generated additional features:\n",
    "- Returns Calculation: Daily percentage change in stock price:\n",
    "  ```python\n",
    "  \n",
    "  df[\"Return\"] = df.groupby(\"Company\")[\"Close\"].pct_change()\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "- **Price Indicators**:\n",
    "  - Prev_Close: Closing price of the previous day.\n",
    "  - Price Change**: Difference between current and previous close price.\n",
    "  - Volatility: 5-day rolling standard deviation of closing prices.\n",
    "- **Technical Indicators**:\n",
    "  - **Simple Moving Averages (SMA)**:\n",
    "    ```python\n",
    "    df[\"SMA_10\"] = df.groupby(\"Company\")[\"Close\"].transform(lambda x: x.rolling(window=10, min_periods=1).mean())\n",
    "    df[\"SMA_50\"] = df.groupby(\"Company\")[\"Close\"].transform(lambda x: x.rolling(window=50, min_periods=1).mean())\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **3. Data Transformation**\n",
    "- Converted timestamps to `datetime` format for easier time-series processing.\n",
    "- Sorted data by `Company` and `Date` to maintain chronological integrity.\n",
    "- Normalized price data where necessary for reinforcement learning models.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## **Final Processed Dataset**\n",
    "- Companies Tracked: Multiple (e.g., AAPL, TSLA).\n",
    "- Observations: Over 600,000 records post-cleaning.\n",
    "- **Key Features Used**:\n",
    "  - OHLC prices\n",
    "  - Volume\n",
    "  - Returns\n",
    "  - Moving Averages\n",
    "  - Volatility\n",

    "# Proposed Solution\n",
    " \n",
    "Our approach optimizes algorithmic trading strategies by integrating reinforcement learning (TD Learning) and Dynamic Programming (DP) to make data-driven trading decisions. Instead of relying solely on rule-based or traditional statistical models, we use machine learning techniques to predict market movements and execute optimal buy/sell strategies.  \n",
    "\n",
    "##### **Problem Formulation: Trading as a Sequential Decision Process**\n",
    "We model the trading problem using Temporal Difference Learning and Dynamic Programming to determine the best buy, sell, or hold decisions based on historical stock data. Our goal is to maximize portfolio returns by learning from past market movements and optimizing trade execution.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### **1. State (S): Market Representation**\n",
    "Each state represents the market at a given time and includes:  \n",
    "- **OHLCV Data**: Open, High, Low, Close, Volume.  \n",
    "- **Technical Indicators**: Moving Averages (SMA, EMA), Volatility, Relative Strength Index (RSI), MACD.  \n",
    "- **Market Trends**: Rolling price changes, trend momentum.  \n",
    "- **Portfolio Status**: Current holdings, cash balance, previous transactions.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### **2. Actions (A): Trading Decisions**\n",
    "At each time step, the algorithm decides between:  \n",
    "- **Buy**: Purchase stock at the current price.  \n",
    "- **Sell**: Sell stock at the current price.  \n",
    "- **Hold**: Maintain the current position.\n",
    "\n",

    "- **Profit Maximization**: The reward function is defined as:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\[\n",
    "R_t = P_{t+1} - P_t\n",
    "\\]\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Transaction Costs**: Penalize excessive trading to minimize fees.  \n",
    "- **Holding Time Penalty**: Discourage holding onto a losing position for too long.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### **4. Dynamic Programming (DP) for Trade Optimization**\n",
    "Once TD Learning generates price predictions, Dynamic Programming (DP) is used to backtrack from the final date to identify optimal buy/sell points. By systematically evaluating potential trading decisions over time, DP finds the most profitable trades across the entire prediction window, outperforming naïve strategies.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Implementation Steps**\n",
    "1. **Data Preprocessing**: Clean and engineer features from Yahoo Finance data.  \n",
    "2. **TD Learning Prediction**: Train a reinforcement learning model on historical prices.  \n",
    "3. **DP Optimization**: Apply Dynamic Programming to maximize profit using predicted prices.  \n",
    "4. **Strategy Backtesting**: Compare TD+DP Trading Strategy against the Buy-and-Hold Benchmark using real stock market data.  \n",
    "5. **Performance Evaluation**: Measure effectiveness using Sharpe Ratio, Total Return, and Drawdowns.\n",
    "\n",
    "By combining machine learning, TD Learning, and Dynamic Programming, our approach enhances decision-making in trading and adapts dynamically to changing market conditions."
